 30‑Day Linear Algebra Bootcamp

This repository contains a 30‑day guided learning program for mastering the fundamentals of Linear Algebra.  
It includes Colab‑ready Jupyter notebooks, a master checklist, and a quick‑start guide for students.

 About this course
I am using these materials to teach a structured Linear Algebra course.  
The course blends theory, short drills, and guided coding exercises (NumPy/Matplotlib) to help learners build both conceptual understanding and practical skills in 30 days.

 Who this course is for
- Students who want a structured crash course in Linear Algebra  
- Self‑learners revisiting math after a break  
- Programmers & data enthusiasts looking to strengthen math foundations for machine learning or data science  
- Educators seeking a ready‑to‑teach linear algebra bootcamp format  
- Anyone who wants a fast, focused, 30‑day path to understanding Linear Algebra  

 What’s inside
- Day 0: Setup & Refresh (Python + algebra review)  
- Days 1–30: Daily notebooks with:
  - Concept explanations  
  - 10–20 short exercises  
  - Guided coding tasks in Python  
  - Optional challenge problems  
- Master checklist with daily Khan Academy links and study routines  
- Quick‑start guide for using this program  
- Progress tracking sheet  

 Syllabus

 Week 1: Vectors & Geometry
- Vector operations (addition, scaling)
- Dot product, magnitude, angles
- Linear combinations, span, and independence
- Subspaces, bases, and dimension
- Matrices as linear transformations

 Week 2: Matrices & Systems
- Matrix addition, multiplication, and inverses
- Systems of equations as \(Ax=b\)
- Gaussian elimination & row reduction
- Rank, null space, column space, and row space

 Week 3: Determinants & Eigenvalues
- Determinants and their properties
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Diagonalization
- Orthogonality, projections, and orthogonal matrices

 Week 4: Applications & Synthesis
- Least‑squares solutions
- Singular value decomposition (SVD)
- Change of basis & advanced transformations
- Applications: PCA, data compression, and graphics
- Final review and project ideas

 How to use
1. Clone this repository or [download as ZIP]()  
2. Open any notebook in Google Colab:  
   - Right‑click → “Open with Colab”  
3. Follow the daily plan in the master checklist (≈2 hours/day).  

 Goal
By the end of 30 days, students will have a strong foundation in Linear Algebra and be able to apply these skills to problem‑solving, coding, and data analysis.
